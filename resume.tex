\section{Projects}

\project{Insurance Optimization Engine}{Professional (Verdova)}
{
    \item A tool which finds optimal combinations of USDA insurance products and commodity options
    to minimize risk and maximize returns for growers (Python, Postgres)
    \item Responsible for: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Turning a 77 page USDA specification into a working insurance premium calculator
        \item Gathering input from industry experts
        \item Knowledge brokering once this project was re-scoped into a separate company
    \end{itemize}
}

\project{Grower Portal}{Professional (Verdova)}
{
    \item Web app which allows growers to connect their data with Verdova, visualize their data (through maps, charts, tables),
    and enroll in data deals (Python/Django, John Deere API, JavaScript/Svelte, Postgres)
    \item Responsible for: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item API layer (djangorestframework)---acts as liaison between the database, John Deere API, and frontend, 
        can be replicated as needed to support an increase in users
        \item Reducing database accesses (\texttt{select\_related}, \texttt{prefetch\_related}, \texttt{assertNumQueries})
    \end{itemize}
   
}

\project{Ray Tracer}{Academic (Production Computer Graphics)}
{
    \item Ray tracer with jittering, BVH (Rust)
    \item Orthographic and perspective modes supported
}

\project{Dispatch}{Professional (Fulcrum GT)}
{
    \item Mobile app which suggests flights and hotels based on individual preferences,
    company policy, team requirements---intended for teams of business professionals 
    (ex. management consultants) (Java/Dropwizard, Amadeus API, Postgres)
    \item Responsible for: crud backend (return user state \& such), 
    business logic (generate flight, hotel itineraries / suggestions)
    \item Dispatch was demoed at ILTACON (major legal sector networking event)
    where it received moderate interest
}

\project{Essential Tasks ToDo List}{Personal}
{
    \item Flutter based app built for roommate who suffers from an executive 
        function disorder and poor working memory to help keep track of essential 
        tasks such as eating and bathing (Flutter, SQLite)
    \item App state is saved locally (SQLite)
}
%
\project{Esim}{Personal}
{
    \item 3D Coulomb's Law visualization built for physics teacher (Java, OpenGL/GLSL)
    % \item Allows users to place point charges in a plane and see a 3D graph of the electric potential at each point in the plane
}

% \project{Julia Set Explorer}{Personal}
% {
%     \item Julia set viewer with pan and zoom capabilities (Rust, OpenGL/GLSL)
%     \item Fractal is colored by OpenGL shaders to maximize performace (GLSL)
%     \item Contributed a pull request to glium/glium
% }

% \project{Genetic Algorithm Image Evolution}{Acedemic (Software Design Studio)}
% {
%     \item Genetic algorithm which recreates a user provide image using simple 
%         shapes (C++, openFrameworks)
% }
